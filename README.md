# GA FEWD Final Project: Jen Reyes Photography


This is my final project for General Assembly's Front End Web Development 10-week course.


## Overview
This website is a passion project of mine to showcase my photography work and now my front end development coding skills!


## What I have demonstated
1. Make a website responsive
2. Create a hamburger icon and developed a mobile/tablet view navigation menu
3. Create a slideshow
4. Display photos in a responsive image grid
5. Make an anchor link
6. Use flex and grid properties

## Challenge that I've faced and overcame
How to make a hamburger icon clickable.  This took me 2 days to figure this out without raising the white flag to ask for help!

## What I still need to practice on
1. Javascript
2. Javascript
3. And more javascript
